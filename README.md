1. The Client for this project was the Gaming Room. Before starting the project, the Gaming Room had a game Draw it or Lose it only available on the android platform and the Gaming Room wanted to expand to more platforms. 
2. In developing the documentation, I made a strong list of each of the individual platforms and their capabilities, this made choosing a developing platform easier and gave strong credence to the best choice for the project, keeping in mind cost and availability to support. 
3. Utilizing a design document in my opinion allows for the alignment of the project and keeping ideas in check and not allowing for scope creep. 
4. I think I would choose to update my executive summary to allow for more detail to better give a understanding and to try and get more attention and more traction from the executive team because ultimately the executive team will be the go or no go on the project. 
5. It is important to consider the usersâ€™ needs when designing to allow for seamless use and user use not just what makes the code work.
